                    <h4> Sigiriya  </h4>

                    <p> Siriya is one of the most valuable historical monuments of Sri Lanka. Referred by locals as the 
                        Eighth Wonder of the World this ancient palace and fortress complex has significant archaeological importance and attracts thousands of tourists every year.
                         It is probably the most visited tourist destination of Sri Lanka.
                        The palace is located in the heart of the island between the towns of Dambulla and Habarane on a
                         massive rocky plateau 370 meters above the sea level. </p>

                    <h4> Minneriya national park </h4>

                    <p> The Minneriya National Park is in the Northern province of Sri Lanka, four hours away from Colombo, and 30 minutes 
                        away from Sigiriya. The national park is famous for its herds of elephants migrating for food, water and shelter,
                         and forming a 'gathering' that can be witnessed by the visitors. The dry season is the best time to visit this place, 
                         as the majestic elephants migrate to the Minneriya Tank for water. Apart from elephants, the national park is also home t
                         o several mammals, birds, reptiles, and different kinds of plant species. Minneriya National Park comes under the dry zone, meaning, 
                         it receives less rainfall compared to the other areas in the country. </p>

                    <h4> Wilpattu national park </h4>

                    <p> hree scenic hours away from Jetwing Vil Uyana is Sri Lanka’s oldest and largest national park, Wilpattu.
                         The Mahavamsa, our ancient chronicle, also details the significance of this historic land as the landing point 
                         of the Indian Prince Vijaya who, in union with the Sri Lankan Princess Kuveni, founded the Sinhala race of the island.
                        In our shared spirit of natural magnificence, Vil Uyana also shares a portion of our name with the revered Wilpattu, 
                        which is derived from the vernacular terms ‘villu’ and ‘pattu’, translating to the ‘Land of Lakes’. The magnetism of
                         these watering holes across the parkland draws inhabitants both endangered and endemic, including the famous ‘big three’ 
                         of Sri Lanka – the Asian elephant, the Sri Lankan sloth bear, and the Sri Lankan leopard.
