                    <h4> Gangaramaya temple </h4>

                    <p> The Most Visited temple in the city, the Gangaramaya Temple which organizes Sri Lanka’s largest and the most colourful Vesak festival annually, has a history of 120 years.
                        It was established in 1885 by Venerable Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayaka Thera at a time when Buddhist and cultural resurgence were much needed as the country was under the colonial rule.
                        The area that was once a swamp beside the Beira Lake, has now turned to be an iconic complex which consists of the temple, 
                        the assembly hall in the breathtaking lake and the vocational training institute.
                         Earlier, devotees had to cross the Beira Lake on a boat in order to reach the then small temple which was converted to what is today by the Devundara Sri Jinaratana Nayake Thera, 
                         a pupil of Venerable Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Nayaka Thera who appointed him as the chief incumbent of the temple. </p>

                    <h4> Galle face green </h4>

                    <p> Sri Lanka, being an island, is known for her amazing beaches and views of the sea. However, in Colombo,it isn’t always easy to find a place where you can enjoy the crashing of the waves and most of all, 
                        an undisturbed view of the sunset. Galle Face Green thus attracts a large number of people, especially during the evening, although it is rarely empty, even in the afternoon when there is very little shelter from the scorching sun.
                        Galle Face Green (Galle Face Beach) is a half kilometer promenade in the heart ofColombo and was initially laid out in 1859 by Sir Henry Ward, Governor of British Ceylon. 
                        The stretch of land was used for horse racing and golf and was known as the Colpetty Race Course.                        
                        Today, Galle Face Green is a favorite place for families, children, lovers and picnickers. While the hot sun makes carrying around an umbrella a must and the crows are a nuisance,
                         it is still a beautiful place to relax, enjoy the beach and have meals. There is enough space to walk around, sit and even fly kites. During the kite season, the skies over Galle Face Green are hidden behind the colorful kites that bring joy to the young and old.
                          Those who enjoy people watching will be able to do a lot of observing at Galle Face Green, as it attracts people of various cultures, ethnicities and ages. </p>

                    <h4> Viharamahadevi park </h4>

                    <p> Once widely known as Victoria Park, Viharamahadevi Park is Colombo’s oldest and largest public park. Situated within an older section of the city it lies close to historical monuments such as the colonial-era Town Hall building,
                         the National Museum, and the ColomboPublic Library. Having received extensive renovations recently, it is now an essential location where the city’s residents relax and enjoy themselves. 
                         The park was built, by Charles Henry de Soysa during the British rule of Sri Lanka, on land donated to the Colombo city; and was named "Victoria Park" after Queen Victoria.
                         It was occupied by the British Army during World War II, and was where the Australian 17th Brigade was based. After the war the park was restored and open to the public in 1951,  and at the time it was named Viharamahdevi Park after the ancient Queen Viharamahadevi. 
                         This queen was the mother of King Dutugamunu who was an important figurehead of Sri Lanka’s history.                        
                         Another face of the park’s history was the cricket ground that used to be within the park. It was used for international level cricket games between 1927 and 1995.
