                    <h4> Haggala botanical garden </h4>

                    <p> The second largest botanical garden in Sri Lanka, Hakgala Botanical Gardens is picturesquely situated in the hill country,
                         a mere ten kilometres (six miles) away from the city of Nuwara Eliya. The comfortable cool weather that prevails throughout the year compliments the exotic flora and fauna, 
                         creating a true paradise.According to the legends, the history of Hakgala Gardens dates back to the time of Ramayanaya; an epic love story of the east.
                         Queen Sita, captured and brought to Sri Lanka, is said to have been hidden in this vicinity - the Hakgala Gardens at that time was one of the pleasure gardens of King Ravana.
                        The present day Hakgala Gardens was established in 1861 under the patronage of Dr G H W Thawaites. Originally it was used for the cultivation of cinchona and later for tea. 
                        The development of Hakgala Gardens as a botanic garden was initiated by Mr William Nock and since then many varieties of flowers and trees, both local and foreign, have been introduced.

                    <h4> Ramboda falls </h4>

                    <p>RAMBODA FALLS
                        Ramboda falls of sri lanka is one of the  the most beautiful waterfalls of sri lanka.Rivers, as they flow over uneven ground or down mountains, often split into tributaries or form waterfalls. 
                        Sometimes two tributaries of the same river may form twin waterfalls very close to each other as the water spills down cliffs and rocks.
                        However, it is quite uncommon for the tributaries to combine after forming the waterfalls making a Y shape.                       
                        This unique and beautiful sight can be seen at the Pussellawa area of Nuwara Eliya, at the Ramboda Pass.
                         The Ramboda Falls in Sri Lanka orRamboda Ella or Puna Ella as these falls are called is created from Puna Oya, a tributary of Kothmale Oya. 
                         It makes a twin with Dunsinane Falls which is created by Pundalu Oya, also a tributary of Kothmale River, and combines at the base to form a Y shape.
